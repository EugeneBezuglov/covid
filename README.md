# Covid Data Exploration

In this project, I made an overview table(view) that helps compare covid statistics in various countries.
I also explored correlation between death rates and infection rates and various factors, such as diabetes prevalence, smoking, gdp, median age, life expectancy and so on.
This correlation is broken down by continent, which helps get insights on how different the world is.
